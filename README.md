# Tiles

### Tiles
Our project is a digital interface to be used in innovation workshops for children (age 8-12) based on a card deck called Tiles. The Tiles card deck consists of 110 unique cards, which are sectioned into different categories. The overall idea is to enable innovative thinking processes by using combinations of these cards in a workshop-like manner. These innovative ideas can be for example Internet of Things (IoT) items, that can be produced later. The different combinations of the cards are going to give the users an interactive metaphor, which in our case will be animations. The users can be able to save their ideas as both text or audio.


### Background and Motivation 
A physical interface for this idea already exists (http://inven.tools/), but this is a more complex application, since this is targeted at youths. Our project task is mainly about digitising this interface. In addition to digitising the already existing physical interface, the group will ensure that the children are satisfied and able to use the interface in a convenient and effective way. Together with our costumer we thought that smaller children have a lot of great and innovative ideas that might be useful in the future of Internet of Things. With this in mind, it was fun to develop the application.

### Features
Unique for this project is the way the application is organised. The children only have to pick out three cards and then an animation is automatically generated based on the combination of these cards. With this in mind, they can experiment with different cards. They are also able to record their idea as audio for themselves. We think that this can help them come up with innovative ideas and to think outside the box.

### Visuals
[Depending on what you are making, it can be a good idea to include screenshots or even a video (you'll frequently see GIFs rather than actual videos). Tools like ttygif can help, but check out Asciinema for a more sophisticated method.]
The user will be directed to a front page with the possibility to start picking out cards. When they have chosen three cards they can "make" the animation. The picture below shows how this pages looks. This is where the children can save their idea as text in the database or record an audio file and download it to their computer.

### Usage
[Use examples liberally, and show the expected output if you can. It's helpful to have inline the smallest example of usage that you can demonstrate, while providing links to more sophisticated examples if they are too long to reasonably include in the README.]
